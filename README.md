## Overview

This repository contains my solutions for the [**Java Programming
** Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) offered by the University
of Helsinki.](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/)

## Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** installed
- **NetBeans with TMC plugin** configured for either “Java Programming I” or “Java Programming II”
- A free **MOOC.fi** account to submit exercises and track progress  
  Installation instructions are available in the course material.

## Course Structure

The course is divided into two sequential parts: **Java Programming I** (Parts 1–7) and **Java Programming II** (Parts
8–14).

---

### Java Programming I

1. **Part 1: Diving Into Programming**

   In the first part you install and configure NetBeans + TMC, write your very first “Hello World” program, and master
   the fundamental building blocks of Java: printing to the console, reading user input, declaring and using variables
   of
   different types, performing arithmetic calculations, controlling program flow with conditional statements, and
   reflecting on the societal impact of software.

2. **Part 2: Repetition and Modularity**

   Emphasizes patterns that recur in programming, teaching you to employ loops (both `for` and `while`) for
   repeated tasks, extract repeated code into reusable methods, and wrap up with a questionnaire that reinforces best
   practices in program structure and design.

3. **Part 3: Lists, Arrays, and Strings**  
   During the third part, you learn to collect and manage data using `List`and array abstractions, manipulate text via
   the `String` class, and diagnose common errors—wrapping up with a summary of how collections and text processing fit
   into everyday Java programs.

4. **Part 4: Introduction to Object‑Oriented Programming**  
   Pivots to object‑oriented design: defining classes, creating lists of objects, reading structured data
   from files, and using objects to represent real‑world entities—culminating in a summary that ties together file I/O
   and OOP principles.

5. **Part 5: Deepening OOP Concepts**  
   Building on the previous part, the fifth part drills into advanced OOP topics: constructor and method overloading for
   eliminating repetitive code, understanding differences between primitive and reference types, and solidifying your
   grasp of object references and memory behavior.

6. **Part 6: Composition and Testing**  
   Explores how objects can contain other objects (composition), separates the user interface from program logic
   for cleaner design, introduces unit testing practices, and guides you through constructing more complex, multi‑class
   applications.

7. **Part 7: Paradigms, Algorithms, and Large‑Scale Exercises**  
   The final segment of Java Programming I overviews major programming paradigms, delves into basic algorithmic
   thinking, and challenges you with larger exercises that integrate all concepts learned so far—setting the stage for
   the advanced course sequence.

### Java Programming II

8. **Part 8: Short recap & Hash Maps**  
   Briefly reviews Parts 1–7, then introduces the `HashMap` class for fast key‐based data retrieval and practical use
   cases.

9. **Part 9: Inheritance, Interfaces & Polymorphism**  
   Covers class inheritance, interface implementation, and object polymorphism—core OOP principles in Java.

10. **Part 10: Streams, Lambda Expressions & Comparable**  
    Teaches collection processing with streams (`filter`, `map`, `collect`), lambda expressions, and implementing
    `Comparable` for custom object ordering.

11. **Part 11: Class Diagrams, Packages, Exceptions & File I/O**  
    Explores UML class diagrams, Java packages and `import` statements, exception handling (`throw`, `try-catch`), and
    basic file reading/writing.

12. **Part 12: Generics, Custom ArrayList/HashMap & Multidimensional Data**  
    Introduces type parameters (`<T>`), building generic classes, inner workings of `ArrayList`/`HashMap`, random number
    generation, and multidimensional arrays.

13. **Part 13: Graphical User Interfaces & Event Handling**  
    Teaches Swing/AWT basics: creating GUIs, UI components and layout managers, event listeners, and multi‐view
    applications.

14. **Part 14: Data Visualization, Multimedia & Larger Application**  
    Covers Java’s chart APIs (line/bar charts), basic image and audio handling, and culminates in building a complete
    Asteroids‐style game using Maven and third‐party libraries.
